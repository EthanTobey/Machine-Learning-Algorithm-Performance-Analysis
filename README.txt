This file describes the running of the machine learning tests explored in the document 
irisNetwork.ipynb In order to run the file, the following must be installed:

 - Jupyter Notebook functionality
 - Ski-kit learn
 - Tensorflow
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
 - Pandas
 - Numpy

To examine the file, different cells can be run independently. It is recommended to run them in order, since
some of the cells build upon each other. The file can also be run all at once.

Upon running, please allow a few minutes for the training of the different models. Once the training of all models
is complete, the graph outputs of each model's performance can be viewed in the notebook outputs.
